        <h2>Is your web presence working for you?</h2>
        <h4>If someone needs what you provide, will your website draw them in? What will they see if they are on their phone? A responsive & accessible web presence is no longer merely a 'bonus' or 'nice to have' - it is essential.</h3>
        <h4>It is my privilege to offer a chance to be seen on the web to small businesses and individuals around me. Whether that be creating a website for you from the ground up, or updating an existing presence for the mobile age. Providing a place for interested parties to find and learn about what you offer is what I offer. How can I help you today?</h3>

                <li>Creation - Clients receive regular updates regarding their project status while I create and test it.</li>
                <li>Launch & Support - Peace of mind is delivered with the final project in the form of available ongoing support.</li>
